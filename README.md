An application to track cryptocurrency prices (NOT in real-time).

* Steps to setup
- Run 'yarn install'
- Run 'yarn start'

See it in Action :

Things I'll add if I have more time :)
1. Setting dynamic display limit and options to load more
2. More error handling and error message display on UI
3. Unit test cases :)
